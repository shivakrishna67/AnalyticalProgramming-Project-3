Motor Vehicle Crashes in New York City Analysis

## Overview
This project explores and analyzes motor vehicle crash data in New York City (NYC). The dataset used in this analysis contains information about various aspects of motor vehicle crashes, including time and location, contributing factors, vehicle types, and severity of incidents.

The primary objectives of this project are:

### Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Conduct a thorough exploration of the motor vehicle crash data to identify patterns, trends, and insights.

### Temporal and Spatial Analysis: Investigate how crash rates vary over time (hourly, daily, monthly) and across different locations within NYC.

### Contributing Factors: Analyze the contributing factors to motor vehicle crashes, such as distracted driving, speeding, and impaired driving.

### Comparative Analysis: Compare the motor vehicle crash data in NYC to national averages or other urban areas to identify unique characteristics and potential areas for improvement.

## Dataset
The dataset used for this analysis is sourced from [provide the source or link to the dataset]. It includes [mention key columns and information included, e.g., date, time, location, contributing factors, etc.].

## Tools and Libraries
The analysis is performed using Python programming language and utilizes popular data analysis and visualization libraries, including:
Pandas: Data manipulation and analysis.
NumPy: Numerical operations and calculations.
Matplotlib and Seaborn: Data visualization to create insightful plots and charts.
